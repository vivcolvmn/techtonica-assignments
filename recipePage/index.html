            <ol>
                <li>Move oven rack so that it is in the second from the top space. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Brush
                    2 tablespoons of olive oil on a large baking sheet and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Cut the eggplants into lengthwise pieces about 1 inch thick. Sprinkle salt on both sides and let sit for 30
                    min or longer.
                <li>After 30 minutes, pat the eggplant dry with a paper towel, then season with salt and pepper</li>
                <li>In one shallow dish, whisk eggs</li>
                <li>In another shallow dish, mix together panko bread crumbs, grated parmesan cheese, salt, pepper, garlic powder, oregeno,
                    and black pepper.
                </li>
                <li>Dip one eggplant slice into the egg, allow excess to drip off. Then dip it into the breadcrumb mixture until it is fully
                    coated in breadcrumbs. Press crumbs firmly against eggplant with your hands. Place on prepared baking sheet, repeat with

                <li>Place baking sheet in the oven on the second from the top rack. Bake for 20 minutes then flip and bake for another 20 min,
